# MZ1P16
Forth words to control the original SHARP MZ-1P16 connected to an SHARP MZ-800 vintage home computer.
The words were written in MZ-FORTH back in 1999 for an original SHARP MZ-1P16 plotter connected to a SHARP MZ-821.

I had added words that exist in MZ-FORTH but did not in ANS- or gforh at the time of writing the code. But I had never tested these in real life.

* MZ-FORTH was a Forth implementation for the MZ-800 series of home computers from SHARP. I do not know who owns the legal rights for it. I do not. Any information is welcomed and will be added here as soon as possible.

## Caveat
At the moment the comments and also most of the Forth words are in German only. Currently I have no intention to translate it to e.g. english.

**Yes, it is only one file, that's all!**
